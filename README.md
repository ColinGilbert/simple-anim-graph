This is a simplified version of anim-graph-rs, my other Rust animgraph library (https://www.github.com/colingilbert/anim-graph-rs). It is intended to be the one that gets worked on moving forward.

Uses ozz-animation under the hood. Currently a work-in-progress.

While the previous one worked to a certain extent, it was too complicated to be considered satisfactory. This rewrite is to be pretty much a drop-in replacement.
